                Sauraha is a picturesque village located near Chitwan National Park, Nepal’s first national park, established in 1973. Originally a small Tharu settlement, Sauraha has grown into a popular tourist destination due to its proximity to the park and its rich biodiversity.

The Chitwan National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984, played a pivotal role in shaping Sauraha’s identity. Once a hunting ground for Nepalese royalty and foreign dignitaries, the area was transformed into a conservation hub to protect endangered species such as the Bengal tiger, one-horned rhinoceros, and gharial crocodile.

In the 1980s, tourism began to flourish in Sauraha as visitors from around the world came to experience jungle safaris, birdwatching, and traditional Tharu culture. Over time, Sauraha developed into a vibrant gateway for eco-tourism, offering activities like canoe rides, elephant safaris (now largely replaced by jeep safaris to promote animal welfare), and cultural programs showcasing Tharu dance and heritage.

Today, Sauraha remains a blend of natural beauty and cultural richness, attracting nature enthusiasts and researchers while contributing significantly to the local economy.
